# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Supported Versions

Active full support: 1.3.5 (latest), 1.3.0 (previous). Security maintenance (critical fixes only): 1.1.0. All versions < 1.1.0 are End of Security Support (EoSS). See `SECURITY.md` for the evolving support policy.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-02-21

### Major Architecture Change: Supabase Migration

- **Database Engine**: Fully migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL via Supabase.
- **Authentication**: Replaced NextAuth.js with Supabase Auth (SSR clients + middleware).
- **Core Models Refactored**:
  - `stories` & `user_interactions` mapped correctly for the feed.
  - `royalty_configs`, `creator_earnings`, and `royalty_transactions` fully off-chain tracked via Supabase.
- **Legacy Removal**: Safely commented out `Mongoose` schemas and active connections to prevent build collisions while keeping types intact.
- **Improved Data Integrity**: Shifted to explicit Row Level Security (RLS) rules and robust primary/foreign key mappings (UUID).
- **Dependency Fixes**: Fixed broken 404 package dependencies (e.g. `concat-stream` github link) preventing fresh installations.

### Fixed

- **Vercel Deployment Crash (npm ci)**: Switched Vercel install command from `npm ci` to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` permanently due to persistent ERESOLVE and missing dependency errors in lockfile synchronization within the Vercel build environment.
- **Vercel Deployment Crash (Spline 3D)**: Added `transpilePackages` for `@splinetool/react-spline` and `@splinetool/runtime` in `next.config.js` so Next.js properly compiles Spline's class inheritance chain through its SWC pipeline instead of treating them as pre-compiled externals
- **Resilient Spline Loading**: Added `.catch()` fallback to the Spline dynamic import in `app/page.tsx` — if the 3D model fails to load in any environment, the page gracefully degrades to the gradient background instead of crashing
- **Featured Creators Validation**: `components/featured-creators.tsx` now validates creator-shaped objects (requires `username`/`followersCount`/`profileImage`) instead of fabricating metadata; non-matching items are filtered out
- **Footer Health Indicator**: Wired the static "Online" indicator in `components/footer.tsx` to the real `/api/health/db` endpoint — now dynamically shows Online/Degraded/Offline/Checking state
- **Trending Stories Error Handling**: `components/trending-stories.tsx` now surfaces the actual error message (instead of hiding it behind "No Stories Yet") and provides a Retry button
- **Spline Guide Markdown**: Added `text` language identifiers to unlabeled fenced code blocks in `docs/SPLINE_GUIDE.md` (markdownlint MD040)
- **Changelog Deduplication**: Merged duplicate `## [1.3.5]` headers into a single section
- **Feed API Static Render Fix**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to `app/api/feed/route.ts` — route uses `request.url` for query params, which requires dynamic rendering
- **Missing 404 Page**: Created `app/not-found.tsx` with comic-style 404 page matching the site theme
- **ServiceWorker 404**: Created `public/sw.js` minimal stub to prevent registration failure
- **Dialog Accessibility**: Added hidden `DialogDescription` to `components/ui/dialog.tsx` to satisfy Radix `aria-describedby` requirement
- **Hero Background**: Replaced Spline 3D with `background.jpeg` for the hero section — works in both light and dark modes with overlay
- **Global Loading Screen**: Created `app/loading.tsx` using the existing `LoadingScreen` component for consistent loading across all pages
- **Scroll Indicator Accessibility**: Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the decorative scroll indicator in `app/page.tsx`
- **Trending Stories HTTP Errors**: `components/trending-stories.tsx` now surfaces 4xx/5xx responses as errors instead of silently showing empty state
- **Trending Stories AbortController**: Added `AbortController` cleanup to prevent state updates on unmounted components
- **Featured Creators HTML Validity**: Used `Button asChild` pattern in `components/featured-creators.tsx` to avoid invalid `<a><button>` nesting
- **Animated Genre Marquee**: Replaced the 6-genre icon grid with a 12-genre animated marquee using real genre images, infinite right-to-left scrolling, hover-pause, edge fade masks, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- **Adventure Image Fix**: Replaced broken europeanstudios.com hotlink with working Unsplash adventure image
- **Genre Page Overhaul**: Rewrote `app/genres/page.tsx` — genre cards now have real images, expand/collapse famous works, "Write a Story" CTAs, and an interactive "Finding Your Genre" quiz (4 questions, emoji, progress bar, results)
- **Documentation Page Overhaul**: Rewrote `app/docs/page.tsx` — step cards with numbered badges, quick links grid, expandable FAQ accordion with emojis, wallet setup guide, minting flow, and community CTA banner
- **Duplicate Trending Header**: Removed redundant "Trending Stories" heading from `components/trending-stories.tsx` since the home page already provides its own "Trending Now" header
- **Community Loading Screen**: Updated Community Hub page to use full-screen loading with `fullScreen` and `size="lg"` props, consistent with the global loading screen

### Documentation & Professional Standards

- **Created Professional Pull Request Template (`temp.md`)**: Implemented a standardized, professional PR template for Indie Hub Org members.
- **Indie Hub Org Alignment**: Added mandatory acknowledgement for official membership and professional work line.
- **Clean Documentation**: High-quality, emoji-free, and streamlined template for internal project contributions.

### Homepage & Footer UI Refinements — Readability, Layout, and Spline Background

#### Changed
- **Spline 3D Background**: Transitioned from hero-only to a `fixed` full-page background, visible through semi-transparent sections.
- **CTA Section**: Removed gradient background, simplified to `bg-background/90` with backdrop-blur.
- **CTA Button**: Removed sparkle icon, enforced pure comic-style theme with Bangers font.
- **Neon Sign**: Optimized glow radii and colors for significantly improved readability.

- **IntersectionObserver for Spline**: Tracks hero section visibility to control Spline model opacity in lower sections
- **Dark Premium Background**: Sitewide `dark-premium-bg` class applied to main layout wrapper — elegant radial gradients on deep navy
- **Feed API Fallback**: `/api/feed/route.ts` now returns 6 high-quality fallback stories when MongoDB is unavailable, ensuring trending stories section always renders
- **Full-width Neon Sign**: GROQTALES neon branding now spans the entire screen width on all devices (phone, tablet, laptop, TV) using `w-screen -ml-[50vw]` breakout technique

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-05

### Major Changes (1.1.1)

- **Production Deployment Focus**: Removed all blockchain/Web3 functionality to focus on core AI storytelling features
- **GROQ-Only Integration**: Eliminated LLAMA support, maintaining only GROQ API for story generation
- **Clean Architecture**: Commented out all onchain scripts and wallet mockups for streamlined deployment

### Technical Improvements (1.1.1)

- **Build Stability**: Fixed all `GROQ_MODELS.LLAMA_3_70B` compilation errors
  - Updated API routes to use existing GROQ models (`STORY_GENERATION`, `RECOMMENDATIONS`, `STORY_ANALYSIS`)
  - Added `generateContentCustom()` function for flexible GROQ API calls
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved parsing errors in dialog components
  - Fixed malformed interface definitions in `story-comments-dialog.tsx` and `story-details-dialog.tsx`
  - Eliminated build-blocking syntax errors

### Blockchain/Web3 Functionality - Temporarily Disabled

- **NFT Minting**: Disabled `app/api/monad/mint/route.ts` - returns 503 status with "temporarily disabled" message
- **Wallet Integration**: Replaced `components/connect-wallet-button.tsx` with placeholder showing "Wallet (Coming Soon)"
- **NFT Marketplace**: Commented out `components/nft-marketplace.tsx` and `components/nft-purchase.tsx`
- **Web3 Provider**: Replaced `components/providers/web3-provider.tsx` with stub implementation
- **Blockchain Services**: Disabled `lib/monad-service.ts` with preserved original code in comments
- **Web3 Hooks**: Removed `hooks/use-web3-auth.ts` completely

### File Changes

- **Removed Files**:
  - `hooks/use-web3-auth.ts` - Web3 authentication hook (completely removed)
- **Modified Files**:
  - `app/api/monad/mint/route.ts` - NFT minting endpoint (disabled)
  - `components/connect-wallet-button.tsx` - Wallet connection (placeholder)
  - `components/nft-marketplace.tsx` - NFT marketplace (disabled)
  - `components/nft-purchase.tsx` - NFT purchasing (disabled)
  - `components/providers/web3-provider.tsx` - Web3 context (stub implementation)
  - `lib/monad-service.ts` - Blockchain service (disabled)
  - `lib/groq-service.ts` - Enhanced with generateContentCustom function
  - `app/layout.tsx` - Uses disabled Web3Provider

### Bug Fixes (1.1.1)

- **API Routes**: Fixed story generation endpoints using undefined GROQ models
- **Component Imports**: Updated all Web3-related component imports to use disabled versions
- **Interface Definitions**: Fixed broken TypeScript interfaces causing parsing errors

### Developer Experience (1.1.1)

- **Code Preservation**: All original blockchain functionality preserved in comments for future restoration
- **Clean Separation**: Blockchain features cleanly disabled without affecting core AI functionality
- **Build Process**: Resolved all compilation errors for successful production deployment

### Deployment (1.1.1)

- **Production Ready**: Application now builds successfully without Web3 dependencies
- **Simplified Stack**: Focus on core AI storytelling features using GROQ API
- **Public Deployment**: Ready for deployment without blockchain complexity

### Migration Notes (1.1.1)

- **Blockchain Features**: All Web3/blockchain functionality is temporarily disabled but preserved in code comments
